# Static Plane Frame Analysis Software

## Description

The Static Plane Frame Analysis Software is a powerful tool designed for engineers and structural analysts to perform comprehensive structural analysis of plane frames. The software utilizes classical methods of structural analysis to determine member forces, displacements, reactions, and other important parameters.

This project was developed as part of my BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) final year project back in 2010. Its aim is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for analyzing static plane frames, allowing engineers to gain insights into the behavior and performance of various structural configurations.

## Features

- Intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for defining frame geometry and properties.
- Capable of handling different types of loadings, including point loads, distributed loads, and moments.
- Supports various boundary conditions, such as pinned, fixed, and roller supports.
- Efficient matrix-based analysis algorithms to solve for member forces, displacements, and reactions.
- Visualization of frame geometry, member forces, shear forces, bending moments, and displacements.
- Detailed result reports with numerical data and graphical representations.
- Export functionality to save analysis results for further analysis or reporting.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- [VB.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/visual-basic) development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) installed on the target machine.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone or download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Samson-Mano/Plane_frame_analyzer.git`.
2. Open the project in your VB.Net development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build the solution to compile the software.
4. Run the application and start analyzing static plane frames.

### Usage

1. Launch the software.
2. Create a new project or open an existing one.
3. Define the frame geometry, member properties, and support conditions.
4. Specify the applied loads and their locations.
5. Run the analysis to obtain the member forces, displacements, and reactions.
6. Explore the analysis results through the graphical interface and numerical data.
7. Generate comprehensive reports for documentation or further analysis.
8. Export the analysis results if needed.
